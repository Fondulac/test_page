# Overview

Bring up a new menu that:
	Allows user to set options (==are there other options relevant to this?==)
	 - What website to clone
	 - What JS scripts to include in the website 

Upon confirming the user options, BeeKeeper will generate code that not only includes the original website code but also the JS that the user requested. 

It also needs to find all the inputs and redirect the form data to itself  without breaking the webpage (too much). 

# To do list

- [ ] Design how the menu should look
- [ ] Implement basic design (pop up)
- [ ] Add buttons to the pop up and build API for it
- [ ] Figure out how to clone websites ...
- [ ] Build basic website cloner
