# Goal

When opening a menu other than the one the user is currently on, all menus should shrink out of view before opening the new menu. 

### Current menu list
- Submenu
- Campaign div boxes
- Orbs

# Plan of implementation 

Before moving on to implement the function described below, it will be necessary to implement code that allows a user to click a button and close the menu after it has been selected. This feature must be implemented for the following buttons: 

- Bee campaign button
- IP addresses in submenu (orbs)
- New campaign button

add a closeMenus() function that can be called from other functions in the JS 

- Submenu - the submenu is linked to a global flag called "subhivemenuCreated," check what this flag is set to, if TRUE, close the menu
- Campaign div boxes should also receive their own flag when they are implemented. 
- Orbs do not have a clear method to check if they are open or not currently.
- New campaign button has a class that is set to OPEN or CLOSED depending on it's state, this can be used to check if the menu needs to be closed.
