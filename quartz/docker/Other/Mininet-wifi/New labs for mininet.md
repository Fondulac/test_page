# Lab: Recon with Kismet

```
mkdir /opt/wifi/kismet
cd /opt/wifi/kismet
kismet
```

Browser required (wifi, wifilabs)
	data sources
	enable source

Will need to setup multiple networks 
# Lab : De-Cloaking a hidden SSID

Can be combined with the one above, single lab: "recon"

# Lab: Bettercap Recon 

Can be combined with the one above, single lab: "recon"

# Lab: Bettercap Wifi Authentication Capture

use WPA 4 way handshake lab and cracking

# Lab: Packet Capture to HCCAPX Conversion and Hashcat Cracking 

Combine with WPA 4 way handshake lab and cracking

# Lab: Airsuite Tools - recon and pre-shared key recovery 

use WPA 4 way handshake lab 

# Lab: Cracking WPA handshakes with aircrack-ng


use WPA 4 way handshake lab 

# Lab: Lateral movement (joining the WPA-LAB network)

Does this only involve joining the network? 

# Lab Airgeddon: denial of service beacon attacks

use WPA 4 way handshake lab 

# Lab: Capture active directory credentials with evil-twin attacks

Use eaphammer lab 

# Lab: EAPHammer - hostile portal credential capture

Not entirely possible - use eaphammer lab 

# Lab: cracking NetNTLM credentials with John the Ripper

use eaphammer lab
# Lab: Air-Hammer.py 802.1X password spray

requires separate lab 

# Lab: Active Directory Pwnage 





	Will need to reformat menu 


# Plan

- [ ] Create list of new labs mapped to existing menus (note new options that need to be created)
- [ ] Rename existing options to better fit their purpose (transition from lab based to network based menu options)
- [ ] Test the new labs on the networks (may need to add more hosts to some)
- [ ] Create labs (add new checklist items under this one)
- [ ] Push changes to main branch of repo
- [ ] Recompile, and push
