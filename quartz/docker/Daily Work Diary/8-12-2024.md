started work in the Sturgis office at 8:30 AM. 
Agenda for today: 
- Port all writeups from the old lab repo to the new one
- Make writeups for lab 3.1, 3.2, and 4.1
- Access state of BeeKeeper project, increase readability of code and make an obsidian dev log for it
- Start researching LTE capabilities of mininet-wifi 

Writeup for 3.1 took longer than expected. Ran into issues with the retraining portion of the lab in which the students poison the lab by fine tuning it's training set with hugging face's autotrainer. 

Autotrainer failed to recognize certain fields in the dataset. Testing revealed that it was due to the file being a .json file and not a .jsonl file. 

Overall, the entirety of the 12th was spent moving files between repositories, updating the lab documents in the new repository to link to all the other lab documents, and finetuning the process of lab 3.1 while creating the writeup/screenshots. 


Will spend tomorrow doing the following:

Producing writeup for lab 3.2
Assess the state of BeeKeeper and develop a roadmap for future development.
