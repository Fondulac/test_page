Plans: 

Finish the search button 
	- Update GUI to display links to successful search targets
	- Links should open the campaign info window when clicked
	- Fix the sandwhich alerts 
	- Clean up code (remove old variables, add comments, organize functions/eventLiseners)

Progress: 
- Fixed a variety of UI bugs
- (Painfully) restructured the code surrounding opening and closing of sub menus    
- Added backend code for campaign deletion 
- Laid foundation for search button functionality
