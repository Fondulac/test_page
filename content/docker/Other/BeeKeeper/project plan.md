# Project Purpose 

BeeKeeper clones websites for the purpose of generating HoneyPots that, upon being visited, captures data on the user in order to create a unique fingerprint for the visitor.   


# Tool use

## General use

Each campaign is represented by a bee (this menu can be accessed by hovering over the beehive icon on the bottom of the screen). Upon clicking a bee, a sub menu containing the IP addresses of all honeypot visitors should appear. Selecting an IP address brings up a dashboard containing information on the visitor, such as their location, operating system, device, and any inputs they provided to the honeypot. In addition, an all button can be selected to view statistics regarding all honeypot visitors.

Reports containing information of the campaign owner's choosing can be generated in PDF format. 

## Fingerprinting users

The tool will attempt to automatically fingerprint users and provide information between users that exhibit similar behaviors.
