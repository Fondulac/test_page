Started work at 10:00 am. Talked to Justin Angel and Jordan Drysdale about hiring. Did QA on lab4.1 for the AI course. 

Spent way to much time figuring out how to remove a large file from a past commit. 
The following is the solution if it happens again. Git will still attempt to upload failed refs to the remote repo alongside any new commits, even if the file in the failed commit is removed. The solution requires going back to the commit before the failed ref was pushed. 

```bash
git log #git the commit hash made BEFORE the failed ref commit
git reset --soft <HASH>
```

# Lab 4.2

In lab 4.2, we want to demonstrate building an AI that makes predictions based on the percentage from the model. 

Generate three categories of inputs
(Wealthy) (100000 - 200000) (700-800)

(Medium) (32000 - 60000) (700-800)

(Poor) (0 - 21000) (700 - 800)

For each class, generate 500 queries to the model for each city. 
Append the percentage to a pandas dataframe that contains the following:

City_Code
Wealth
Credit_Score
Chance

Output the table for the users to observe the output. 

# Researching Angel Project

![[Pasted image 20240808145636.png]]

## Project Responsibilities

- Develop and maintain Gitlab CI/CD pipelines
- Implement services to support pipelines (HCP Vault, Headscale)
- Create docker images to support automation efforts
- Use Pulumi to automate cloud infrastructure 
- Manage states of cloud infrastructure using salt
	- Including expanding existing automation to deploy and configure additional C2 frameworks. 
- manage custom OS image management for cloud and custom internal services 

## Infrastructure Automation 
*Referred to as Fully Automated Deployments (FAD*

Infrastructure automation creates and configures various cloud resources while providing the user updates on completion details. 

### Key Deployment Types

- [[Nexus-ng]] - Overt remote access system for penetration tests 
- [Quick-C2] - Deploys and configures Cobalt Strike and BruteRatel 

### How it works 

- CI/CD pipelines utilize a variety of technologies to deploy and configure systems and components upon an operator's request. 

## problems to consider

- Deployment of cloud infrastructure requires setting up VPNs, CDNs, DNS records etc. 
- Automated configuration of VPS, C2 services, and file transfer services
- Collection and delivery of testing support artifacts to VPS (obfuscated tooling)

## key technologies used

- Gitlab CI/CD
- Docker for CI/CD images
- Pulumi
- Salt
- Go/Python 

## Supporting Components 

1. Operators generate input document for infrastructure requests through the [[operators companion]]
2. Operators submit the input for infrastructure requests in the [[infrastructure requests]] repository as an issue, triggering a webhook request to the [[Issue Relay Server]]
3. The issue relay server accepts the request, parses the output, and kicks off a deployment pipeline in the [[infrastructure deployments]] repository 
4. Upon completion, a comment is auto added to the GitLab issue created in step 2, alerting the user of any deployment details.
