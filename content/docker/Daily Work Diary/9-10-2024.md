# Agenda
BeeKeeper
- Implement template creator
- Implement dynamic flask generator code into the main beekeeper codebase
- Catalog

# Link Format href

http(s) 
://
subdomain.com
/route/to/page


1. format the link for the request - ensure that the base and https:// is in the link
2. format the flask server route and file name
	- route should be the route provided by the page
	- if the page is a subdomain, use the domain name as the root of the route

links in the original document need to match the routes set in the previous function

# Idea for github sync

Two branches - the main branch to which everything is pushed to and an second branch that will exclusively handle pushes to the github branch 

On push to main branch
- Sync both branches to match
- On the github_staging branch, search for files/dirs with the ignore value and add these files to the gitignore file and also remove them from the branch 
- Push the updated repo / gitignore file to the github_stating branch
- Push the branch to github
