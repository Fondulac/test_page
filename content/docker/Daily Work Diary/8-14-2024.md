Started work at 8:00 AM in the strugis office. 


Plans for today: 
- Add function that creates a new JSON file in the campaign directory that corresponds to the new IP addresses that connects to the clone. 
- Implement the coordinate grabber -> fill in the JSON file
- Implement collecting of user and network information 


# Problem 

When a cloned webpage calls the API route in the flask backend to pass it information - how does the backend know which campaign clone is sending the information? 

## I1
- Include the clone name / path in the file

Easy implementation - gives away some information to a potential attacker

## I2

Generate a unique code for each clone, include that code in the API call, refer to a dictionary that maps IDs to file routes. 

Improvement upon the previous idea - same principle but hides the paths and clone names.

# Actual Progress

Added a function that creates a new JSON file when a new IP visitor is dectected
Coordinate grabber passes information to JSON file
Partial implementation of network and user information

Future, need to figure out how to obfuscate JS in the clone's frontend or figure out how to collect the information without putting code in the clone.
