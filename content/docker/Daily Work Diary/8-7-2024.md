Started work around 11:00 in the morning. 

Began by looking into methods to save the AI model made from yesterday so that it didn't have to retrain itself every time the user made a query. 

Added the following to the file, saving a model with 5000 entries worked well.

```python
def save_model(model):
	joblib.dump(model, "model.pkl")
```

Trained a model with five million entries and uploaded it to a huggingface repo under the account redblackbird. An appropriate README was added to the repo.

Running the model in a new repo revealed that the pip packages used to build the original model were outdated and resulted in a model incompatible with the current versions of the packages. Model was rebuilt using up to date versions of packages. 

The HTML and flask backend for the lab was built up to a decent looking and operational standard.

Updated version of model file uploaded to huggingface. 
Updated version of git repo updated to github repo. Model.pkl is too big for the git repo - will have to be pre packaged in the lab docker.
